# DotNetWallet
Cross platform Bitcoin wallet implementation in .NET Core for a CodeProject tutorial: [Build a Bitcoin wallet in C#](https://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/ArticleVersion.aspx?waid=214550&aid=1115639)  
  
The wallet might also will turn out to be the first iteration of a dedicated wallet for a Bitcoin privacy improvement technique, called [TumbleBit](https://github.com/BUSEC/TumbleBit). TumbleBit will be integrated through [NTumbleBit](https://github.com/NTumbleBit/NTumbleBit), however in a new repository with new name. This repository will stay as is for the shake of a the CodeProject tutorial.  
For further directions of its development see: [HiddenWallet](https://github.com/nopara73/HiddenWallet/). This is its new, rebranded name.  
  
The wallet can communicate with the network through HTTP API and paved the way for a full node integration.  
It has a Command Line Interface.
  
## How to use it
The app is cross-platform, you can try it in any OS. You only need to get [dotnet core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).  
After you acquired dotnet core build the software:  

```
git clone https://github.com/nopara73/DotNetWallet/    
cd DotNetWallet/DotNetWallet/  
dotnet restore  
dotnet build  
```  

Run the app once, it will generate your configuration file, called `Config.json`, then open it:  

```
dotnet run  
gedit Config.json  
```

Default config looks like this:

```
{
  "DefaultWalletFileName": "Wallet.json",  
  "Network": "Main",  
  "ConnectionType": "Http",  
  "CanSpendUnconfirmed": "False"  
}
```

**"Network"** can be `"Main"` or `"TestNet"`. Change to testnet for the shake of practice.  
**"ConnectionType"** can be `"Http"` or `"FullNode"`. Full node mode is not implemented.  
**"CanSpendUnconfirmed"** can be `"False"` or `"True"`. Change to "True", so you can play around with it without waiting for confirmations.  
  
### Walkthrough  
  
Generate a wallet with `dotnet run -- generate-wallet`.  
**Output:**
```
Choose a password:
***
Confirm password:
***

Wallet is successfully created.
Wallet file: Wallets/Wallet.json

Write down the following mnemonic words.
With the mnemonic words AND your password you can recover this wallet by using the recover-wallet command.

-------
virus into smooth shock eternal task guitar bus glide taste glow barrel
-------
```
Recover your wallet to an other wallet file:  `dotnet run -- recover-wallet wallet-file=recovered.json`  
**Output:**
```
Your software is configured using the Bitcoin TestNet network.
Provide your mnemonic words, separated by spaces:
virus into smooth shock eternal task guitar bus glide taste glow barrel
Provide your password. Please note the wallet cannot check if your password is correct or not. If you provide a wrong password a wallet will be recovered with your provided mnemonic AND password pair:
***

Wallet is successfully recovered.
Wallet file: Wallets/recovered.json
```
[Get some testnet bitcoins](http://tpfaucet.appspot.com/) to the wallet. You can get unused addresses with:  `dotnet run -- receive`
